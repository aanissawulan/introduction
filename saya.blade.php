<h1 style="color:black;text-align:center;font-family:justaword;"> 10 things we love about the Chamber of Secrets </h1>
<p style="font-family:papyrus;"> 

In some ways, Chamber of Secrets was more exciting than the Philosopher’s Stone, because we’d just fallen in love with the book, and were clambering over ourselves to carry on with the story.

<h2 style="color:black;text-align:center;font-family:justaword;"> 1. Dobby, naturally</h2>
<p style="font-family:papyrus;text-align: center;">
Probably one of our utmost favourite things about the entire Harry Potter series put together is Dobby; the bravest house-elf that ever bashed himself on the head. This is the book where we first meet Harry’s new, well-meaning, but also quite calamitous friend, when he turns up at Privet Drive begging him not to return to Hogwarts. Despite constant rebuffs, Dobby turns up at numerous unwanted times to remind Harry that he’s in great danger, etc – not that Harry ever listened. As we quickly learn, Dobby had Harry’s best interests at heart, and a friendship was born: not to mention, a great love of socks.

  <p style="font-family:papyrus;" title="2. Gilderoy Lockhart">

  It is still something of a miracle that the flamboyant, humble-bragging Gilderoy Lockhart ever got the gig as Hogwarts’ new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher in the first place, but you can’t deny the man had charisma. After nearly fooling everyone thanks to his lovely, blonde, tumbling tresses and his endlessly unrealistic sounding novels (Year with the Yeti, Gadding with Ghouls…) Lockhart’s tenure came to a dramatic close when he erased his own memory with Ron’s broken wand. Kind of sad, but on the other hand…
